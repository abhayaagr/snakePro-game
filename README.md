- Polished UI: Simple and visually appealing interface.

## Purpose
This project was developed to:
- Demonstrate front-end development skills by building a game from scratch.
- Explore JavaScript for creating game logic and interactions.
- Practice integrating multimedia elements (audio and video) in web applications.
